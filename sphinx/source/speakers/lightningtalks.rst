JSON Schema Validation for the Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:Speaker: Herman Schaaf

JSON Schema can provide clean form validation where the same rule definitions can be re-used both on the client- and server-side. This represents a new, clean approach to handle web form validation, and it's a method that is slowly gaining traction. 

Using JSON Schema in Python provides extra re-usability. In this short talk I will give a quick run-down of how we baked JSON Schema into a Bottle-based web framework to handle form-, request- and even response-validation transparently through Python decorators.

Programming Problem "FizzBuzz" (Rule: print the Integer from 1 to 100, but when the integer is multiple of 3, output "Fizz", and when the integer is multiple of 5, output "Buzz", and multiple of both 3 and 5 is output "FizzBuzz") is very Simple but can think many approach of various kind. ex. Basic, Object-Oriented, Lambda, Decorator, Closure , Reflective, Functional ... and More !! "FizzBuzz" includes  the art of computer programs !!

Webデザイナーの間で話題になりつつあるMac App "CodeKit" では、SSIの文法に近似した独自言語 "Kit Language" を使用することができ、その仕様は公開されています。
この ”Kit Language"" のコンパイラーをPythonで実装しましたので、これを紹介します
